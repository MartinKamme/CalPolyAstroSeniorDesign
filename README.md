# CalPolyAstroSeniorDesign
Cal Poly Astronautics Senior Design Project

Our year long senior design project was a proposal for a NASA Small Spacecraft Technology Program RFP. The goal was to design a system that would provide continuous and global navigation and telecommunication capabilities for a Lunar Settlement.  

As a GNC engineer I:
-Designed the direct Earth-Moon transfer trajectories for CY 2023 using AGI's STK. 
-Designed the satellite deployment scheme for the Lunar Constellation using MATLAB
-Worked with all other subsystems to ensure our design was congruent and that we met the RFP requirements.
