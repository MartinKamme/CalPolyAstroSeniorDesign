# CalPolyAstroSeniorDesign
Cal Poly Astronautics Senior Design Project

Our year long senior design project was a proposal for a NASA Small Spacecraft Technology Program RFP. The goal was to design a system that would provide continuous and global navigation and communication capabilities for a Lunar Settlement.  
The RFP and a presentation of some of my contributions are included in the repository. 
Please reach out to me with any questions!
